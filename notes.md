# Claude PMR upload order + notes

> Good morning Claude! I've reviewed your Staged Processing Plan and I think it sounds good. I've got a few things to mention before we get started though:

> Per your phased plan, I'll begin with the foundational documents. We **<u>*MUST*</u>** have a complete and thorough understanding and internalization of these. To wit, ***please take as much extended time as you need*** to thoroughly review them to ensure you've got a deep-dive level understanding of the new methodology and its philosophical underpinnings. I do *not* need any notes or summary regarding these.

> For Stage 1, I propose the following: 

> * Tranche 1:THE ⭐Methodology⭐ itself. ***NOTE***: this is the PMR that contains the documented filesystem structure that I mentioned earlier in this conversation. I am *not* deadset on sticking to *that* layout, though it is something we'd put considerable thought into, going through a few iterations to arrive at that one. However, if you have any ideas for improvements, I welcome constructive criticism! You did say that after processing the backlogs "[you will] suggest initial organization in the `~/.claude/`structure"—that's something I was going to ask for anyway, so great!
> 
> * Tranche 2: My PMR generation prompt, including the example documents I gave you as guidance. ***NOTE***: these docs contain info about Projects that *should* have their own PMR's that I'll upload in Stage 2, but I think there's still useful information in them, so please review and internalize them nonetheless.
> 
> Then we move on to Stage 2. ⚠️ Regarding Stage 2, I'm a Max plan subscriber now! So with 5x more usage than Pro plans, I would think that I shouldn't have to worry about tokens and usage limits here. It'd be great if you could cross-reference *all* of them simultaneously to identify those connections and overlaps between backlogs that I guarantee you are going to find. After all, that's what this whole methodology is all about!! There are exactly 21 PMR's totalling 376 kB on disk. One of the PMR's will also come with an additional 3 related documents totalling 56 kB on disk. Please let me know if you're comfortable receiving and processing all of those simultaneously or if you still think we shoud batch them. 

> I'm less concerned about error recovery. I'm pretty sure there will be *conflicts*, but we can resolve those as needed, just like we would in a jj/git project. But if you're worried about it, then we can batch them.

> Additionally, I trust you, but if you want me to validate your approach on one small batch before we process the rest, we can do that. We could start with a small "thematic" batch and if all works out, move on to the rest.

> You already know this but the backlogs are all *inside* the PMR's. Those will need to be separated off into their own standalone docs, but given their relevance, all of the other sections in the PMR's deserve to be retained and stored in the new filesystem too, as critical historical project documentation! After we get them all uploaded, we can discuss how we want to go about breaking the backlogs off from the PMR's and populating the new filesystem with everything. I welcome your thoughts on this too.

> ***NOTE***: The final section of each PMR should be Section III— '**Conversation Context Summary**'—*those* sections are *just for you*! *I* don't need those in the new filesystem, but they won't be completely trashed. I suggest we keep an archive copy of each PMR after they're parsed.

> ***NOTE***: Some projects, namely AstralJunction, the AI-Collaborative Project Dashboard, and possibly others, have *more than 1 backlog*. **THESE ARE <u>*NOT*</u> DUPLICATES**. I had conversations with you about them in different Claude Project spaces, so they got a PMR from *each* Claude Project space wherein they were discussed. Give them all equal consideration and make sure all useful information from each one gets retained and consolidated.

> Finally, I'm *sure* there will be contradictions that we need to clear up, so we'll work on those after all the imports.
